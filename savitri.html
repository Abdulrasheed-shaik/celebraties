    <p>Nissankara Savitri (also known as Savitri Ganesan; 6 December 1934[a] – 26 December 1981) was an Indian actress, singer, and filmmaker who predominantly worked in Telugu and Tamil films. Widely regarded as one of the greatest actresses in the history of Indian cinema, she was popularly known by the epithets Mahanati (transl. The great actress) in Telugu and Nadigaiyar Thilagam (transl. Doyen of all the actresses) in Tamil. Savitri was among the highest-paid and most sought-after actresses in South Indian cinema during the 1950s and 1960s.

        In a career spanning three decades, Savitri appeared in more than 250 films. Her first significant role was in the 1952 film Pelli Chesi Choodu. Later, she starred in several critically acclaimed and commercially successful films, including Devadasu (1953), Missamma (1955), Ardhangi (1955), Donga Ramudu (1955), Thodi Kodallu (1957), Mayabazar (1957), Mangalya Balam (1959), Aradhana (1962), Gundamma Katha (1962), Nartanasala (1963),[1] Doctor Chakravarty (1964), Sumangali (1965), and Devata (1965).[2]
        
        Savitri was also known for her philanthropic work and generosity towards the poor. In recognition of her contributions to Indian cinema, she received the "A Moon Among Stars" honor at the 30th International Film Festival of India in 1999.[3] Her life and career were later depicted in the biographical film Mahanati (2018), which won the "Equality in Cinema Award" at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.[4]
        
        Early life
        Savitri was born on 6 December 1934[a] in a Telugu family in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh.[5] Her parents were Nissankara Subhadramma and Guravayya and both of them belonged to Kapu caste.[6][7][8][9] Her father died when she was six months old, after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling Maruti, to live with an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkataramaiah enrolled her in classes when she began to show a talent for dance.
        
        She was named for the expression of her eyes during dramas. She participated in many dramas, in one where she was rewarded with a garland by the famous actor Prithviraj Kapoor. She, along with her uncle, went to the Vijaya Vauhini studio in Chennai to enroll Savitri as a character in a movie, though they refused to do so. Not giving up, they tried once again, in another cinema, where she managed to get a role, but could not stand it as she hesitated in reciting dialogues because she was in awe when talking to the hero.
        
        It was then that she met Ramaswamy Ganesan, also known as Gemini Ganesan, who took pictures of Savitri and instructed the duo that they come after two months. Defeated, Savitri went back to her village and continued playing dramas. On one specific day a man came to their home and asked Savitri to play a role for his cinema. Savitri's career thus began. Savitri married Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan in 1952, having first met him in 1948. The marriage led to a permanent rift with her uncle because Ganesan was already married, had four daughters, and was involved in an affair with Pushpavalli.[10] Her marriage became public when she signed a photograph as Savitri Ganesh.[11] Ganesan admitted that while married to his wife Savitri, with whom he had a daughter and a son, he also had two daughters with Pushpavalli.[12]</p>
